    <h1>The HJCode SpCrypt Program</h1>
    <p>I made this program almost completely by myself, only some necessary fragments are completed by imports. Completely new stream cipher based on the MT19937 algorythm. <a href="rayz0091624.github.io/info.html">Information of the organization</a></p>
    <p>Current version 1.9, and maybe I won't make any major updates till January 2024 due to school work. </p>
    <p>This program is open-sourced (Licensed under the MPT 2.0 License), and you can find the sourcecode at <a href="https://gist.github.com/RayZ0091624/4ceba1bad747c27c413b7abc12af11df">Github</a>. </p>
